## Optimized Minecraft server configs for 1.16.5+

Optimized server configs (bukkit.yml, spigot.yml, paper.yml, purpur.yml) for version 1.16.5.
Just download, unpack and upload (and replace) to your server files.

To enable End just change "allow-end" in bukkit.yml from false to true.
To enable fish spawning just change `water-animals` and `water-ambient` in bukkit.yml to something higher than 0.
