  The best authentication plugin for the Bukkit/Spigot API!

  Prevent username stealing on your server!
  Use it to secure your Offline mode server or to incrase your Online mode server's protection!

  AuthMeReloaded disallows players who aren't authenticated to do actions like placing blocks, moving,
  typing commands or use the inventory. It can also kick players with uncommon long or short player names or kick players from banned countries.
  With the Session Login feature you don't have to execute the authentication command everytime you connect to the server!
  Each command and every feature can be enabled or disabled from our well structured configuration file.â€‹
